# CoinGecko ID Finder

A web application that helps you find CoinGecko IDs for cryptocurrency tickers. Built out of the frustration with CoinGecko's unintuitive ID system, this tool finds CoinGecko IDs based on just a ticker symbol. Results are initially filtered by market capitalization, with additional granular sorting options available.
